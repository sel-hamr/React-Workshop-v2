    <Section.Description>
      React.createPortal is a method provided by React to render components
      outside the DOM hierarchy of their parent component. It allows you to
      mount a child node into a different part of the DOM, independent of
      where it is declared in your React component tree.

  </Section.Header>
  #### Why Use createPortal?

<Section.Description>
  Portals are particularly useful when you need to render elements that should
  visually break out of their parent container or work independently of its
  styling or positioning.
</Section.Description>
**Common Use Cases**

- **Modals and Dialog Boxes** Modals often need to overlay the entire screen and not be constrained by the styles of their parent container.
- **Tooltips** Tooltips need to appear on top of other elements, even when triggered from within deeply nested components.
- **Dropdown Menus** Like tooltips, dropdown menus often need to appear outside of their parent's overflow constraints.
- **Notification Toasts** Toast notifications are typically placed at a fixed position on the screen, independent of the current DOM structure.
- **Global Elements** Some global elements like contextual menus or floating action buttons need to be rendered at specific places in the DOM, such as a body tag.

#### Example :

<Section.Code>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const App = () => {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Portals Demo</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {showModal && (
        <Modal onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}>
          <h2>This is a modal</h2>
          <button onClick={() => setShowModal(false)}>Close</button>
        </Modal>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

const Modal = ({ children, onClose }) => {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div>
      {children}
      <button onClick={onClose}>Close Modal</button>
    </div>,
    document.getElementById("modal-root")
  );
};

export default App;
```
