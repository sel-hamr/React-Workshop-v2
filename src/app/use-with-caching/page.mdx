## Optimizing Data Fetching in React: Using Custom Caching to Prevent Unnecessary Requests

When working with React component, managing data fetching efficiently is crucial to providing a smooth and responsive user experience.\
In many cases using `React.use` or React.useEffect for fetching data can lead to multiple redundant requests, impacting both performance and resource usage. In this post, weâ€™ll explore how to implement a custom caching mechanism to prevent unnecessary fetches while using React.Suspense and React.ErrorBoundary to handle loading states and errors.

### The Problem: Redundant Fetches in React

<Section.container>

Fetching data directly within a component can cause the same API endpoint to be called multiple times, especially when:

- The component is re-rendered multiple times
- The component is unmounted and re-mounted

Using `React.use` or similar hooks without caching results in repeated network requests, which not only slows down the application but also increases server load.

### The Solution: A Custom Cache for Promises

A caching system can store and reuse promises to prevent redundant fetches. Below is an example of a simple caching class and how it integrates into a React component.

```jsx

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  website: string;
}

class Cache<T> {
  private cache = new Map<string, Promise<T>>();

  async fetch(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (!this.cache.has(key)) {
      try {
        this.cache.set(key, fetcher());
      } catch (error) {
        this.cache.delete(key);
        throw error;
      }
    }
    return this.cache.get(key)!;
  }

  clear() {
    this.cache.clear();
  }
}

```

<Section.container>
This `Cache<T>` class stores promises in a map. It ensures that:

- A promise is created only once per key.
- Subsequent fetches return the same promise until it resolves or rejects.

### Using the Cache in a React Component

```jsx
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  website: string;
}

const userCache = new Cache<User>();
export function UserProfile({ username }: { username: string }) {
  // Use the cache to fetch the user data and store it for preventing unnecessary fetches
  const user = use(userCache.fetch(username, () => fetchUser(username)));
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">{user.name}</h2>
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Username:</span> {user.username}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Email:</span> {user.email}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Phone:</span> {user.phone}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Website:</span> {user.website}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
