      Understanding Event Capturing and Bubbling in React
    </Section.Title>
    <Section.Description>
      When working with React, understanding how events propagate through
      the DOM is crucial for building interactive and responsive user
      interfaces. Two key concepts in event propagation are event capturing
      and event bubbling. In this blog post, we'll explore these
      concepts and how they work in React.

  #### Event Propagation
  <Section.Description>
    Event propagation refers to the way events travel through the DOM tree.
    There are three phases of event propagation:
    1. **Capturing Phase:** The event starts from the root of the DOM tree and travels down to the target element.
    2. **Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element.
    3. **Bubbling Phase:** The event travels back up from the target element to the root of the DOM tree.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Event Bubbling
  <Section.Description>
    Event bubbling is the default behavior in most browsers. When an event
    occurs on an element, it first triggers the event handlers on that
    element, then moves up the DOM tree, triggering event handlers on its
    ancestors.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Example of Event Bubbling
    <Section.Code>
    ```jsx
      import React from 'react';
      const BubblingExample = () => {
      const handleParentClick = () => {
          alert('Parent clicked!');
      };
      const handleChildClick = () => {
      alert('Child clicked!');
      };
      return (
      <div
        onClick={handleParentClick}
        style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}
      >
        <div
          onClick={handleChildClick}
          style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#d0d0d0" }}
        >
          Click me!
        </div>
      </div>
      );
    };
    export default BubblingExample;
    ```
  </Section.Code>
  <Section.Description>
    In this example, clicking on the child div will trigger the
    handleChildClick event handler first, followed by the handleParentClick
    event handler due to event bubbling.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Event Capturing
  <Section.Description>
    Event capturing, also known as trickling is the opposite of
    event bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event starts from the root
    and travels down to the target element. To use event capturing in React,
    you can add the capture keyword to the event handler.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Example of Event Capturing
  <Section.Code>
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    const CapturingExample = () => {
    const handleParentClickCapture = () => {
        alert('Parent capture clicked!');
    };
    const handleChildClickCapture = () => {
        alert('Child capture clicked!');
    };
    return (
      <div
        onClickCapture={handleParentClickCapture}
        style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}
      >
        <div
          onClickCapture={handleChildClickCapture}
          style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#d0d0d0" }}
        >
          Click me!
        </div>
      </div>
      ); 
    };
    export default CapturingExample;
    ```

  </Section.Code>
  <Section.Description>
      In this example, clicking on the child div will trigger the
      handleParentClickCapture event handler first, followed by the
      handleChildClickCapture event handler due to event capturing.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Stopping Event Propagation
  <Section.Description>
    Sometimes, you may want to stop the event from propagating further. You
    can achieve this using the stopPropagation method.
  </Section.Description>
  #### Example of Stopping Event Propagation
  <Section.Code>
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    const StopPropagationExample = () => {
    const handleParentClick = () => {
        alert('Parent clicked!');
    };
    const handleChildClick = (e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        alert('Child clicked!');
    };
    return (
      <div
        onClick={handleParentClick}
        style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}
      >
        <div
          onClick={handleChildClick}
          style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#d0d0d0" }}
        >
          Click me!
        </div>
      </div>
    );
};
export default StopPropagationExample;
    ```
  </Section.Code>
  <Section.Description>
    In this example, clicking on the child div will trigger the
    handleChildClick event handler and stop the event from propagating to
    the parent div.
