## Understanding React's flushSync: Ensuring Synchronous Updates

React's automatic batching of state updates is a powerful feature that optimizes performance by reducing the number of re-renders. However, there are scenarios where you need to ensure that state updates and DOM changes happen immediately. This is where `flushSync` comes into play.

<Section.container>
#### what is `flushSync`?

`flushSync` ia a function provided by React that force to process state updates and DOM updates synchronously. This means that any state updates wrapped inside `flushSync` will be applied immediately , and the DOM will be updated right away.

#### Why to use `flushSync`?

In most cases, React's automatic batching is beneficial and should be left as is. However there are specific scenarios where immediate updates are necessary, such as:

1. **Focus management**: Ensuring an element is in the DOM before focusing on it.
2. **DOM Calculating**: Calculating the size or position of an element after it has been rendered.

### Example :Focus Management

Consider a scenario where you nees to show an input field and immediately focus it when a button is clicked.\
Without `flushSync`, the input field might not be in the DOM where the focus is called

</Section.container>

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from "react";
import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

function FocusExample() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  const handleClick = () => {
    flushSync(() => {
      setShow(true);
    });
    inputRef.current?.focus();
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Show</button>
      {show && <input ref={inputRef} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example , `flushSync` ensures that input field is rendered before the focus is called.\

### Example : DOM Calculating

Another common use case is calculating the size or position of an element after it has been rendered.

</Section.container>

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from "react";
import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

function MeasurementExample() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);
  const divRef = useRef(null);

  const updateAndMeasure = () => {
    flushSync(() => {
      setHeight(100);
    });
    console.log(divRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={updateAndMeasure}>Update and Measure</button>
      <div ref={divRef} style={{ height }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here ,`flushSync` ensures that the height of the div is calculated after the state update has been applied.
