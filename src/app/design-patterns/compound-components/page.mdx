## The Compound Components

The Compound Components Pattern allows you to create a collection of component that implicitly share state, offering a more flexible and powerful API for building reusable components. These components collaborate to form a single unit of functionality.

### The classic example of this is `<select>` and `<option>` in HTML:

```html
<select>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select>
```

The `<select>` element manages the UI's state, while the `<option>` elements serve as configurations , defining the available choices anf their values.\
Not , imagine manually implementing this native control in React:

```tsx
<CustomSelect
  options={[
    { value: "1", display: "Option 1" },
    { value: "2", display: "Option 2" },
  ]}
/>
```

This works fine, but it's less flexible than a compound component API, For example . What if you want to add a `disabled` prop to the `<option>` elements?\
With the compound components pattern, you can create a more flexible API that allows you to customize the `<option>` elements:

```tsx
<CustomSelect>
  <CustomSelect.Option value="1">Option 1</CustomSelect.Option>
  <CustomSelect.Option value="2">Option 2</CustomSelect.Option>
</CustomSelect>
```
