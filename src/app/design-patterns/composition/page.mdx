## The Composition

The composition and Layout Components Pattern helps to avoid prop drilling and makes the code more readable and maintainable. The composition pattern is a design pattern that uses the React children prop to compose components together.\
Let's skip to the end here. It's surprising what you can accomplish by passing react elements rather than treating components as uncrossable boundaries. We'll have a practical example in our exercise, so let me show you a quick and easy contrived example to explain what we'll be doing here:

```tsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
  return <Child count={count} increment={increment} />;
}
function Child({ count, increment }: { count: number; increment: () => void }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <strong>
        I am a child and I don't actually use count or increment. My child does
        though so I have to accept those as props and forward them along.
      </strong>
      <GrandChild count={count} onIncrementClick={increment} />
    </div>
  );
}
function GrandChild({
  count,
  onIncrementClick,
}: {
  count: number;
  onIncrementClick: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <small>I am a grand child and I just pass things off to a button</small>
      <button onClick={onIncrementClick}>{count}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This prop drilling stuff is one of the reasons so many people have jumped onto
state management solutions, whether it be libraries or React context. However,
if we restructure things a bit, we'll notice that things get quite a bit easier
without losing the flexibility we're hoping for.

```tsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
  return (
    <Child
      grandChild={
        <GrandChild
          button={<button onClick={onIncrementClick}>{count}</button>}
        />
      }
    />
  );
}
function Child({ grandChild }: { grandChild: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <strong>
        I am a child and I don't actually use count or increment. My child does
        though so I have to accept those as props and forward them along.
      </strong>
      {grandChild}
    </div>
  );
}
function GrandChild({ button }: { button: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <small>I am a grand child and I just pass things off to a button</small>
      {button}
    </div>
  );
}
```
