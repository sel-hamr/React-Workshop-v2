## Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

Controlled components and uncontrolled components are two ways to manage form data.
In a controlled component, the form data is handled by a React component. The form data is stored in the component's state and is updated through the component's setState method. the benefit of using a controlled component is that you have full control over the form data. You can validate the form data, manipulate the form data, and perform other operations on the form data.
In an uncontrolled component, the form data is handled by the DOM itself. The form data is stored in the DOM, and is accessed through the DOM's API. In an uncontrolled component, the component does not manage the form data directly. the benefit of using an uncontrolled component is that you do not need to write as much code as you would with a controlled component. or for simple form with limited interaction You can also use uncontrolled components to integrate with third-party libraries that require direct access to the DOM. However, uncontrolled components are not as flexible as controlled components, and you may run into issues with form data

### Example for Uncontrolled Components:

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef < HTMLInputElement > null;

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(inputRef.current?.value);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example, we have a simple form with an input field and a submit button. The input field is an uncontrolled component because we are using the ref attribute to access the input field's value directly. When the form is submitted, we use the inputRef.current.value to get the input field's value and show an alert with the value.

### Example for Controlled Components:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function ControlledComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(value);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example, we have a simple form with an input field and a submit button. The input field is a controlled component because we are using the value attribute to set the input field's value and the onChange attribute to update the input field's value. When the form is submitted, we use the value state to get the input field's value and show an alert with the value.
